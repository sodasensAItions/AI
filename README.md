This repository contains a jupiter notebook with the results of our AI training. Also included is a copy of our training data and the resulting model. 

If you want to run the model, the easiest solution would be to use our setup in Google colab. You can email Tyler Allen (a02316541@usu.edu) to request access to our google drive folder. There isn't much excitement to this code though, and all results can
already be viewed in the notebook.
